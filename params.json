Thanks for the support and stay tuned.\r\n\r\n### New Project in the Pipeline: \r\n[Reef GUI] (scheduled for Q2 2013)  -  This is a replacement for the Remote CLI in Reef.  We leverage Play and AngularJS to provide a graphical view of Reef's model and attributes.  The first release is read only. Our purpose for moving this way was two fold -  fast development and an intuitive user interface.   It is fairly simple but works. \r\n\r\n### Featured Community projects:\r\n\r\n[REEF](https://github.com/gec/Total-Grid/wiki/Reef)\r\n\r\n[DNP3](https://github.com/gec/Total-Grid/wiki/DNP3)\r\n\r\n### Read More on the [Wiki](https://github.com/gec/Total-Grid/wiki)\r\n\r\n[Join our mailing list for the latest news and updates](support@totalgrid.org)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
