          <h3>Welcome to the Total Grid Community</h3>

<p>An open source community # dedicated to modernizing national power systems and microgrids while driving the development of the Smart Grid. <a href="http://www.greenenergycorp.com/index.html">Green Energy Corp</a> is pleased to sponsor this Community and looks forward to continued partnership with open source developers world-wide. The Total Grid open source ecosystem expands the resources of smart grid problem-solvers to a global community and allows all contributors to more rapidly innovate and advance many viable solutions.</p>

<p>Currently there are two active project sites in the Community — Reef, the SOA platform and core set of services for GreenBus, and DNP3, a rock-solid Distributed Network Protocol stack.</p>

<h3>Featured Community projects:</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/gec/reef/wiki">Reef</a>— The Reef platform forms the foundation of the Total Grid Community and is the upstream project for Green Energy Corp's GreenBus. REEF is a service oriented platform designed to support large automation systems. It consists of data and core services for processing near real-time data and issuing controls, events and alarms. Reef has support for an operational model, supports the archiving of field and application data and includes a set of RESTful API's for application developers. Reef's SOA framework is supported by an AMQP compliant Message Broker.
Visit the <a href="https://github.com/gec/reef/wiki">Reef</a> project site</p>

<p><a href="http://code.google.com/p/dnp3/">DNP3</a> — The goal of this project is to provide the utility industry with a production-ready reference implementation of Distributed Network Protocol (DNP3). The feature evolution will be driven by community involvement.

<h3>Coming Soon:</h3>

<p>Thin Client GUI — A powerful graphical user interface that allows comprehensive data visibility.</p>

<h3>GreenBus™ Architecture</h3>

<p>Green Energy Corp’s GreenBus Platform combines operational support for legacy systems with an open, advanced platform to support smart grid initiatives. We believe that only with open source software, open standards and an open architecture is it possible to optimize adoption of integrated solutions across industry, academic and governmental boundaries.</p>
